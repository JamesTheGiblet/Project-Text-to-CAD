Text to CAD Generator

A web-based application that converts natural language descriptions into 3D CAD models. Simply describe what you want to create in plain English, and watch as your words transform into interactive 3D objects.
This tool is the foundational design engine for the Iron Arm Exoskeleton project.

ðŸŽ¯ Development Priority: Phase 0
The Text to CAD Generator is the first and most critical phase of the Iron Arm development pipeline. The success of all subsequent mechanical and electronic phases depends on this tool.
Project Ecosystem & Timeline
The 8-week plan is structured as follows, with this tool enabling the entire workflow:
 * ðŸ“… Weeks 1-2: Text to CAD Generator (THIS PROJECT)
   * Output: Generates STL files for all mechanical parts.
 * ðŸ“… Weeks 3-4: Iron Arm Phase 1 - Mechanical Build
   * Output: Validates physical design and ergonomics.
 * ðŸ“… Week 5: Project PI Planner Development
   * Output: Plans wiring and electronic layout.
 * ðŸ“… Weeks 6-7: Iron Arm Phase 2 - Electronics Integration
   * Output: A fully functional exoskeleton prototype.
ðŸš€ Features
 * Natural Language Processing: Understands plain English descriptions of 3D objects.
 * Blueprint Confirmation: Generates a clear, human-readable "blueprint" of your design for approval before creating the final 3D model, ensuring accuracy.
 * Real-time 3D Visualization: Interactive Three.js-powered viewer.
 * Multiple Shape Support: Cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and torus shapes.
 * Color Recognition: Supports common color names (red, blue, green, etc.).
 * Dimension Parsing: Extracts measurements and proportions from text.
 * Interactive Controls: Mouse-based rotation, zooming, and panning.
 * STL Export: Export models for 3D printing.
 * Responsive Design: Modern UI with smooth animations.

Week 1-2 Development Goals
 * Day 1-3: Develop the parser and blueprint generator. The core task is to convert natural language commands into a structured JSON blueprint.
 * Day 4-7: Design and iterate on the cuff bracket by generating and refining its blueprint.
 * Day 8-10: Create blueprints for the elbow housing and motor mount.
 * Day 11-14: Generate blueprints for the control box and cable management system.
 * End of Week 2: All component blueprints are finalized and their STL files are ready for Phase 1 printing.
Success Criteria for Phase 0
 * âœ… Text-to-CAD generates accurate blueprints from complex commands.
 * âœ… Blueprints produce usable STL files for all 5 components.
 * âœ… Export functionality works reliably for complex, multi-part objects.
 * âœ… Ready to begin 3D printing immediately in Week 3.
ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start
Prerequisites
 * A modern web browser with WebGL support.
 * Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts.
 * (Optional) A 3D printer for physical prototyping.
Basic Usage
 * Open the HTML file in a modern web browser.
 * Type a description in the text input area.
 * Click "Generate Blueprint".
 * Review the displayed technical blueprint to confirm the tool understood your intent.
 * Click "Create 3D Model".
 * Use mouse controls to explore your creation:
   * Left click + drag: Rotate view
   * Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out
   * Right click + drag: Pan camera
 * Export your model as STL for 3D printing.
ðŸ”¬ Technical Architecture
Core Components
 * Natural Language Parser: Interprets user input to identify design intent, shapes, and parameters.
 * Blueprint Generator: Translates the parsed intent into a structured, intermediate representation (JSON format).
 * 3D Engine (Three.js): Reads the final blueprint to perform geometric operations (unions, subtractions) and render the final model.
 * Export System: Generates an STL file from the final 3D geometry.
Dependencies
 * Three.js (r128): 3D graphics and rendering.
 * Three-CSG-TS (or similar): For handling Boolean (union, subtract) operations on meshes.
 * Modern Browser: ES6+ JavaScript support required.
